This is the digital clock using JavaScript, HTML and CSS that was done previously in Python. Please see notes from chatGPT below:


In this setup:

- The HTML file creates a basic structure with a div where the clock will be displayed.
- The CSS file styles the clock and the page background, similar to the original Python code.
- The JavaScript file updates the clock every 500 milliseconds, similar to the after method in the Tkinter code.
Make sure to put these snippets in their respective files and ensure they are in the same directory for the code to run properly in a web browser.

For responsiveness see explanation below
Explanation:
- Relative Sizing: The width and height of the clock are set as a percentage of the viewport width (vw), making them responsive to the screen size.
- Maximum Size: max-width and max-height are used to ensure the clock does not become too large on bigger screens.
- Responsive Font Size: The font size is set using vw to scale based on the screen width.
- Media Queries: A media query is used to adjust the font size for smaller screens (like mobile devices), ensuring readability.
